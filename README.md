# Tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

These tutorials are a useful introduction to the R programming language
and many of its packages; by doing them, one can learn about R basics,
importing data, plotting, the dplyr package, mapping, iteration,
functions, dashboards, and more. The tutorials were originally developed
to help employees of the Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) with
varying levels of R coding experience learn more R techniques.

To do the tutorials, clone this repository to your own computer. Each
tutorial folder contains all the code files and data needed to do that
tutorial. Do not remove the tutorial folders from your local repository
as this will cause file paths to become incorrect.
